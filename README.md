Description:
============
Linear Learning Model. 
This program generates 1000 random data points within the region X = [-1,1]x[-1,1]. The program picks two random points, and uses them to 
create a line f(x). THe rest of the points are mapped with +1 on one side, and -1 on another.

Linear Regression is then used to calculate a Hypothesis function, g(x). The function is then used on our Data Set to determine
The insample error, Ein.

The experiment is repeated 1000 times, and the Average Ein is returned.
